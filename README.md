# My-Poll-App
This project aims to build a social decision app. 


My Poll App is a web application based on voting theory (Approval, Borda, Simpson, ...) , to help you to make a social decision easier.
This project was presented to defend my Bachelor's degree thesis in Computer Engineering at [UniFi](https://www.unifi.it/), and is the result of an internship carried out from August 2022 to February 2023 at the [MICC](http://www.micc.unifi.it/) in Florence.
